# CMPG-323-Overview-34375309

# Address which repositories will be created and used for each project
 
All of my projects will have their own repository and the "CMPG 323 Overview 34375309" repository will be many used to track my progress throughout the semester.  For example, Project 1, will be on "CMPG 323 Overview 34375309" and Project 2 will be in its own reporsitory to keep the "workspace" clean and prevent cluster. If I find it diffcult to incorporate, I will have seperate repositories for each project, and only have use the one repository (CMPG 323 Overview 34375309) for all my projects.

# Explain the branching strategy to be used within each project

In each project, I will have a main branch that will have the main project, and different branches for different features. From the sub branches, when the feature is complete and fully working, I will merge the branch with the main branch. This will ensure that all the branches have their on bug fixes, updates and not "mess up" and complicate the main branch.

# Explain the use of a .gitignore file within each project 
When using .gitignore file, this will give you the reassurance that,  when you are sharing your project with other, some information will be "hidden" from them. Stuff like personal files is a good example that will be .gitignore file. I will be using the .gitignore file to "hide" personal infomation, aswell as my log files and unnessecary files like temporary files.

# Explain the storage of credentials and sensitive information

When I will be using mine or others personal credential and sensitive information, I will have two options. Firstly I can store the information on my local device away from the github repository, or I can not save the information at all and keep the sensitive information out of my projects.  

# Project 2

This project is setup of an API so that it will store IoT devices that can be used within our space. I only implemented IoT devices that can be seen in a modern home, but the extention that IoT devices can have within schools, universities and offices is far larger. Stakeholders can use this project to check what IoT devices people are using and where. This will help to develop a market and to show people that IoT devices is the "future" and will make tedious like forgeting the lights on, a simpler task.
Users can use the API to list when and where they use IoT devices in their day-to-day life. This will ensure that the databse get populated and will help the stakeholders get a better idea of what people are using and in what matter.

# Project 3

The program is created to retrieve, display or edit data from a hosted database so that you can remotely make changes. This is useful as many people that is registered and logged in, can make changes/add data that the database consist of.

# Project 4 

The goal of the project is to test the data that you have receive from a excel file, onto a web-base application. I used the software "UiPath" to do the automation and testing, to read the data from the excel file and retrieve the Zone -, Category -, and Device data in their respected sheets in the excel. From there the automation load the data onto the web-base application without you to do it manually. This saves a lot of time, and work effort, because if the data gets more and more, the employee does not have to add the files manually.

# Project 5

I used Power BI to create a visual presentation of the data. Within the presentation, I include a 'Device Monitoring' tab, that contains graph to represent the 'Number of Device within a Category', The Number of Devices that is active' and the 'Number of each Device in each Zone'. In the 'Device Registration' tab, there is three graphs that constains when the 'Devices was installed', 'Number of Devices in each Category' and a timeline of when 'Each device was installed'. This will give the stakeholders a view that is easy-to-understand and that they can visually see what the data has captured.
