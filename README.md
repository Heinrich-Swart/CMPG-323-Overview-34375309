# CMPG-323-Overview-34375309

# All of my projects will have their own repository and the "CMPG 323 Overview 34375309" repository will be many used to track my progress throughout the semester.  For example, Project 1, will be on "CMPG 323 Overview 34375309" and Project 2 will be in its own reporsitory to keep the "workspace" clean and prevent cluster. If I find it diffcult to incorporate, I will have seperate repositories for each project, and only have use the one repository (CMPG 323 Overview 34375309) for all my projects.

# In each project, I will have a main branch that will have the main project, and different branches for different features. From the sub branches, when the feature is complete and fully working, I will merge the branch with the main branch. This will ensure that all the branches have their on bug fixes, updates and not "mess up" and complicate the main branch.

# When using .gitignore file, this will give you the reassurance that,  when you are sharing your project with other, some information will be "hidden" from them. Stuff like personal files is a good example that will be .gitignore file. I will be using the .gitignore file to "hide" personal infomation, aswell as my log files and unnessecary files like temporary files.

# When I will be using mine or others personal credential and sensitive information, I will have two options. Firstly I can store the information on my local device away from the github repository, or I can not save the information at all and keep the sensitive information out of my projects.
